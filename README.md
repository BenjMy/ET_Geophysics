## water-balance OR energy-balance approaches

https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/19/2017/2015/hess-19-2017-2015.pdf

Therefore water-balance and energy-balance approaches are two of the main methodologies for modelling this process. The water-balance approach is usually implemented as a complex, distributed hydrological model, while the energybalance approach is often used with remotely sensed observations of, for example, the land surface temperature (LST) and the state of the vegetation.
