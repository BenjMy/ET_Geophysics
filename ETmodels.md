# ET models

## Empirical models
- Empirical machine learning models: Jung et al., 2019

## Physically-based models

ET models based on mass-transfer theory:

- Land surface models:  Lawrence et al., 2020
- Penman-Monteith based models
- Thermal remote sensing-based surface energy balance models 

### Sources of uncertainties

- semi-empirical parameterization representing surface 90 conditions at a given time such as surface resistance
- 

- surface flux equilibrium (SFE)

# Observations

- Satellite remote sensing-based models
