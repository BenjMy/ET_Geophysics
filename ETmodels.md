# ET models

## Empirical models
- Empirical machine learning models: Jung et al., 2019

## Physically-based models
https://www.fao.org/3/x0490e/x0490e04.htm

### ET models based on mass-transfer theory:

- Land surface models:  Lawrence et al., 2020
- Penman-Monteith based models
- Priestley-Taylor
- Thermal remote sensing-based surface energy balance models 

#### Sources of uncertainties

- semi-empirical parameterization representing surface 90 conditions at a given time such as surface resistance
- 

- surface flux equilibrium (SFE)

### ET models based on Soil Water Balance theory:



# Observations

- Satellite remote sensing-based models
- in-situ ET observations from eddy-covariance tower sites
- ERA5 data
